                    *Erased* follows Satoru Fujinuma, a 29-year-old struggling manga artist, who is sent back in time to his childhood after his mother is murdered. This time travel ability, known as "Revival," lets him prevent accidents before they occur, but the consequences of his actions are far-reaching.
                    <br><br>
                    As Satoru travels back to when he was in elementary school, he becomes involved in a series of kidnappings and murders, including that of his classmate, Kayo Hinazuki. With the knowledge of the future, Satoru attempts to stop the chain of events, all while trying to uncover the truth behind the mysterious killer. *Erased* blends mystery, suspense, and drama as Satoru races against time to rewrite history and save those he cares about.
