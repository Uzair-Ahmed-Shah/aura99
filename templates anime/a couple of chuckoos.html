                    Siblings Nagi Umino and Erika Amano have been living entirely separate lives until an unexpected twist of fate forces them into an arranged marriage. Nagi was raised by his adoptive parents while Erika was raised in a wealthy family, both unaware of their real parents' identities. To add to the chaos, Nagi and Erika discover that their biological parents have switched them at birth, making them "swapped" siblings. As they reluctantly grow closer to each other, they navigate their new relationships, uncover secrets about their families, and experience the usual high school drama, adding plenty of comedy and heartfelt moments along the way.
